This program takes in two strings, the first string is converted into a File using the FIle class. then if the input of the file exists it will
call our search method where the file name matching the string will match and it prints the filepath that matches. Also if our path is a directory, an array 
of subfiles wil be created and the method is called recursively to search all the subfiles.
